Chapter # GCloud

GCloud is a command line interface through which we can manage most of the GCP services. 

GCloud is an excellent tool for deployment, however, GCP is not limited to GCloud CLI as there are other CLI tools available for other services. 

Specific CLI for specific services:

Service Name | CLI name
-------------|---------
Cloud Storage | gsutil
Cloud BigQuery | bq
Cloud BigTable | cbt
Kubernetes | kubectl

GCloud is a part of Google SDK and to install it, your local machine must have **Python** installed. For installation instructions, visit [this.](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

Another web based solution is Cloud Shell. 

On cloud shell, check the version of gcloud.
```
gcloud --version
```

Output:
```sh
xxx@cloudshell:~$ gcloud --version
Google Cloud SDK 370.0.0

app-engine-go 1.9.72
app-engine-java 1.9.93

minikube 1.24.0
pubsub-emulator 0.6.0

```
You can see how many CLIs are already built into it.

Your project default Compute Engine zone has been set to [us-east1-b].
You can change it by running [gcloud config set compute/zone NAME].

Your project default Compute Engine region has been set to [us-east1].
You can change it by running [gcloud config set compute/region NAME].

Created a default .boto configuration file at [/home/XXXgcpcloudengr/.boto]. See this file and
[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config] for more
information about configuring Google Cloud Storage.
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!

* Commands that require authentication will use XXXgcpcloudengr@gmail.com by default
* Commands will reference project `tXXX5` by default
* Compute Engine commands will use region `us-east1` by default
* Compute Engine commands will use zone `us-east1-b` by default

Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings

This gcloud configuration is called [my-default-config]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects.
Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more.

Some things to try next:

* Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command.
* Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the SDK like arg files and output formatting
XXXgcpcloudengr@cloudshell:~ (tXXX5)$
```

The command `gloud init` allows us to authorize gcloud to use your credentials and also reinitialize and setup configurations. 


### gcloud config list

The command `gcloud config list` allows us to see the current configuration.
